#A Brief Introduction to Autoencoders

Deep learning autoencoders are a type of neural network that can reconstruct specific images from the latent code space.

The autoencoders obtain the latent code data from a network called the encoder network. Then we give this code as the input to the decoder network which tries to reconstruct the images that the network has been trained on.
